# Sticky Notes App

A simple React application for creating, updating, and deleting sticky notes. Notes are stored in **localStorage**, so your changes persist across page reloads. You can delete a note by **dragging it over the delete button** in the toolbar.

## Features

- **Add Notes** – Create new sticky notes using the "Add" button.
- **Update Notes** – Edit the content, position, and size of notes; changes are automatically saved to localStorage.
- **Drag & Resize** – Move notes around the screen by dragging them, and resize them from the corner.
- **Delete Notes** – Drag a note over the delete button to remove it.
- **Persistent Storage** – Notes are saved in localStorage and restored on page reload.
